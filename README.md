#machine learning deployment on heroku

The deployed web app is live at https://horlad-analytics.herokuapp.com/

This web app predicts the target of three datasets(Breast Cancer, wine and Iris) using three different machine learning models (KNN, SVM and randomforest) and also enables you to perform some hyperparameter tuning.

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:
* streamlit
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* pickle
* matplotlib

I am testing cloning into my git repo, merging and ppulling changes into the main repo
